# rubix
Rubix cube operations

This is a simple rubix cube representation in Python.  It represents a cube that you can roate up, down, left, or right.  You can rotate the front face either clockwise or counterclockwise.  

This module includes a testing algorithm that will scramble and unscramble the cube to show that all operations are repeatable and capable of being undone.
